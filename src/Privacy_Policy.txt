Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that 
information from Our servers.

If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your 
information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
